# Bunny Bunny

Bunny Bunny is just a simple experiment that I used to attempt linking FFXIV lodestone profiles to discord role metadata.  
It uses a slightly modified [discord-oauth2.py](https://github.com/treeben77/discord-oauth2.py) which saves writing the rest calls myself.

Using Role Connections is a roundabout way of showing external platform data on discord, primarily within a user's popout, including some statistics which aren't being utilised in this project. But given how popular other bots for the game showing profiles that don't have this, I thought it would be a unique thing to tackle. It might be cool to see others doing this in the future.  
The code doesn't provide means for access persistence with updating data as it was out of scope, so unfortunately this cannot be used as a reference for that, but if you're already familiar with discord oauth then this shouldn't be a hurdle.

Happy April Fools.
